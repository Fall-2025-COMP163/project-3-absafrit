# COMP 163: Project 3 - Quest Chronicles

**AI Usage: Free Use (with explanation requirement)**

Update README.md
Document your project with:

Module Architecture: Explain your module organization
    The custom exceptions file, refers to all the exceptions that are raised in other files when an error that is identifiable occurs. Character manager allows to     you creat a character and then save the character along with leveling it up. combat system creates the enemy characters. Most importantly it allows you to         actually fight the enemy characters, try to escape the battle, use special abilities. Item inventory allows you to pull/add and un/equip items from your           inventory. It also allows you to purchase or sell items. The game data file is what allowed the user to save their progress.
Exception Strategy: Describe when/why you raise specific exceptions
    When looking in the inventory to retrieve an item, ItemNotFoundError populates if the item is not in your inventory. InvalidTypeError will populate if you are     trying to retrieve a type of item such as armor and you accidentally select something that is not the type. InventoryFullError is also one that allows the         program to let the user know if their bags are full. If they are, the user should have the option to sell items or use them. The final error that I think was      important was the CharacterDeadError. This allows the program to end and go back to where it was previously saved to try again. This is important, because if      your character dies in a battle, it should not be able to continue to level up or do other actions. 
Design Choices: Justify major decisions
    The biggest decision I had to make was what special abilities each class had. I chose the ones that made the most sense to me such as healing ability for          cleric.  
AI Usage: Detail what AI assistance you used
    I used AI to create the majority of the programs. VS Code made suggestions and I reviewed them before accepting. If there was something I wanted to change I       did that as I went along. I also used Google Copilot to help correct the errors that came up in pytest.
How to Play: Instructions for running the game
  First you select if you want to play a new game, load game, or exit
  if you select new game you then create your character name
  then you select your class from warrior, mage, rogue, or cleric
  it then accesses the game menu where you can view character stats, view inventory, quest menu, explore, shop, save and quit
  because no game has been created to be save you have to start with new game
  I was able to get all the tests to pass, but because of several attribute errors I was unable to get the program to run completely. 

## Overview

Build a complete modular RPG adventure game demonstrating mastery of **exceptions and modules**.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Accept Assignment
1. Click the assignment link provided in Blackboard
2. Accept the assignment - this creates your personal repository
3. Clone your repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [your-personal-repo-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

### Step 2: Understand the Project Structure

Your repository contains:

```

│   └── test_game_integration.py       # Integration tests
└── README.md                   # This file
```

### Step 3: Development Workflow

```bash
# Work on one module at a time
# Test your code frequently

# Commit and push to see test results
git add .
git commit -m "Implement character_manager module"
git push origin main

# Check GitHub for test results (green checkmarks = passed!, red xs = at least 1 failed test case. Click the checkmark or x and then "Details" to see what test cases passed/failed)
```

## Core Requirements (60 Points)

### Critical Constraint
You may **only** use concepts covered through the **Exceptions and Modules** chapters. 

### 🎨 Creativity and Customization

This project encourages creativity! Here's what you can customize:

**✅ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE:**
- **Character stats** - Adjust health, strength, magic for balance
- **Enemy stats** - Make enemies easier or harder
- **Special abilities** - Design unique abilities for each class
- **Additional enemies** - Add your own enemy types beyond the required three
- **Game mechanics** - Add status effects, combos, critical hits, etc.
- **Quest rewards** - Adjust XP and gold amounts
- **Item effects** - Create unique items with creative effects

**⚠️ REQUIRED (for testing):**
- **4 Character classes:** Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric (names must match exactly)
- **3 Enemy types:** "goblin", "orc", "dragon" (must exist, stats flexible)
- **All module functions** - Must have the specified function signatures
- **Exception handling** - Must raise appropriate exceptions

**💡 CREATIVITY TIPS:**
1. Start with required features working
2. Add creative elements incrementally
3. Test after each addition
4. Be ready to explain your design choices in the interview
5. Bonus interview points for thoughtful, balanced customization!

**Example Creative Additions:**
- Vampire enemy that heals when attacking
- Warrior "Last Stand" ability that activates when health is low
- Poison status effect that deals damage over time
- Critical hit system based on character stats
- Rare "legendary" weapons with special effects

### Module 1: custom_exceptions.py (PROVIDED - 0 points to implement)

**This module is provided complete.** It defines all custom exceptions you'll use throughout the project.

### Module 2: game_data.py (10 points)

### Module 3: character_manager.py (15 points)

### Module 4: inventory_system.py (10 points)

### Module 5: quest_handler.py (10 points)

### Module 6: combat_system.py (10 points)

### Module 7: main.py (5 points)

## Automated Testing & Validation (60 Points)

## Interview Component (40 Points)

**Creativity Bonus** (up to 5 extra points on interview):
- Added 2+ custom enemy types beyond required three
- Designed unique and balanced special abilities
- Implemented creative game mechanics (status effects, advanced combat, etc.)
- Thoughtful stat balancing with clear reasoning

**Note:** Creativity is encouraged, but functionality comes first! A working game with required features scores higher than a broken game with lots of extras.

### Update README.md

Document your project with:

1. **Module Architecture:** Explain your module organization
2. **Exception Strategy:** Describe when/why you raise specific exceptions
3. **Design Choices:** Justify major decisions
4. **AI Usage:** Detail what AI assistance you used
5. **How to Play:** Instructions for running the game

### What to Submit:

2. **Interview:** Complete 10-minute explanation session
3. **README:** Updated documentation

## Protected Files Warning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Test Integrity**

Test files are provided for your learning but are protected. Modifying test files constitutes academic dishonesty and will result in:

- Automatic zero on the project
- Academic integrity investigation

You can view tests to understand requirements, but any modifications will be automatically detected.
